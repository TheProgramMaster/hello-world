I have just completed my honors sequence, and intend to apply for REU (Research Experience Undergraudate) positions in the coming Summer 2023 season. I have plans to apply to University of Louisville's graduate school program for a Masters in Computer Science, possibly followed by a PhD in the same university's doctorate school. I am involed in multiple STEM organization, including serving as treasurer for the Euclidean Math Club as well as secretary of the MSU chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery.
